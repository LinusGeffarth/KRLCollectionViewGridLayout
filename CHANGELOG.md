# KRLCollectionViewGridLayout CHANGELOG

## 0.3.0

* Changed headerReferenceSize/footerReferenceSize (CGSize) properties to headerReferenceLength/footerReferenceLength (CGFloat) properties.
* Updated demo project to swift 1.2/Xcode 6.3.

## 0.2.0

* Added support for headers and footers, via the headerReferenceSize and footerReferenceSize properties.
 * Headers and footers behave similarly to UICollectionViewFlowLayout. In vertical mode, only the height of the reference size is considered. In horizontal mode, only the width is considered. 
 * Headers/footers are inset by the sectionInset, and are separated from the cells by the line spacing.

## 0.1.1

* Fixed a bug where horizontal scrolling layouts did not lay cells out correctly
* Fixed a bug where changing the size of the collection view did not properly invalidate the layout and force a recalculation of attribute frames.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.
